# Vulkan-Visions

Vulkan-Visions is an Android application that generates and displays random colored images with varying textures using Vulkan. It utilizes Vulkan Memory Allocator (VMA) for efficient memory management and showcases real-time texture manipulation without a swapchain.

## Features
- Randomized texture generation with varying colors and patterns.
- Vulkan-based rendering for high-performance graphics.
- Efficient memory allocation using Vulkan Memory Allocator (VMA).
- No swapchain required for rendering textures.

## Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/SanjanaBhagwath/Vulkan-Visions.git
```

## Installation
1. Open the project in Android Studio.
2. Build and run on a Vulkan-supported Android device.

## Requirements
- Android device with Vulkan support.
- Android Studio with NDK installed.
- CMake and Ninja for native builds.

## Usage
1. Launch the app on a Vulkan-compatible device.
2. Watch as the app generates and displays randomized textured images.
3. Modify shader files or texture generation logic to customize visuals.
